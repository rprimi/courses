** Course description

This course is designed to provide the student with a solid grounding in
the techniques of experimentation and subsequent statistical modeling that
form the empirical basis of modern psychological science.  We will 
accomplish this through lectures, textbook reading, and several hands-on
"laboratory" experiences, each designed to give the student a taste of the
research process, including data collection, analysis, and reporting.
All students enrolled in this course are required to have 
*previously taken* PSYC 5300 (Behavioral Statistics).

** NEED TO UPDATE Student learning outcomes

 1. Develop a research question and write hypotheses appropriate for it
 2. Design and conduct a research project to test hypotheses
 3. Analyze data collected from research using computer software
 4. Communicate the findings of research as a complete APA style manuscript

** NEED TO UPDATE Requirements and grading
- online quizzes
- labs
- IRB protocol
- class participation 

** Course Communication

I am your primary resource for this course. I AM an experimental psychologist, so I do the stuff I teach about daily. Hence, my primary interest is for you to learn this material and do well in the course. You may contact me using any means necessary (email and Twitter are the best). That being said, many people prefer to use Blackboard messages. I don’t mind these, but keep in mind that I may not receive your message until I actually open Blackboard. With email/Twitter, if you send me a message at 9:00 pm, I may actually respond pretty quickly. 

** University Policy on "F" Grades

Beginning in Fall 2015, Tarleton will begin differentiating between a failed grade in a class because a student never attended (F0 grade), stopped attending at some point in the semester (FX grade), or because the student did not pass the course (F) but attended the entire semester. These grades will be noted on the official transcript. Stopping or never attending class can result in the student having to return aid monies received.  For more information see the Tarleton Financial Aid website.

** Academic Honesty

Cheating, plagiarism (submitting another person’s materials or ideas as one’s own), or doing work for another person who will receive academic credit are all disallowed. This includes the use of unauthorized books, notebooks, or other sources in order to secure of give help during an examination, the unauthorized copying of examinations, assignments, reports, or term papers, or the presentation of unacknowledged material as if it were the student’s own work. Disciplinary action may be taken beyond the academic discipline administered by the faculty member who teaches the course in which the cheating took place.

In particular, any exam taken online must be completed without the aid of any unauthorized resource (including using any search engine, Google, etc.).  Authorized resources are limited only to the official textbook and any lecture notes from the course.  Any other authorized resources will be provided to you before the exam.  The minimum sanction for violation of this policy is a grade of 0 on the affected exam.

** Students with Disabilities Policy

It is the policy of Tarleton State University to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act and other applicable laws. If you are a student with a disability seeking accommodations for this course, please contact the Center for Access and Academic Testing, at 254.968.9400 or caat@tarleton.edu. The office is located in Math 201. More information can be found at www.tarleton.edu/caat or in the University Catalog.
