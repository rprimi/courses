* Philosophical underpinnings
The goal of research is to find the *one truth*...however, the *paths are many*.  Let's see how an ancient Hindu text can actually serve as a metaphor for how we do science.

Three paths to enlightenment (Bhagavad Gita, 500 BCE):
1. Karma yoga - the path of /action/
2. Jnana yoga - path of /knowledge/
3. Bhakti yoga - path of /devotion/

These map nicely onto Royall's (1997) three questions one should ask regarding data:
1. What should I do?
2. What's the relative evidence?
3. What should I believe?

Paths for research:
1. *Path of action*: search for rules to govern our /behavior/ such that, in the long run, we will not be wrong too often
  - $p < \alpha$: reject $H_0$
  - $p > \alpha$: remain in doubt
  - A rule to govern our /behavior/ in the /long run/.  It tells us /nothing/ about the /current test/.

2. *Path of knowledge*:  compare the likelihood of different hypotheses, given the data.
  - suppose you flip a coin 10 times: you get 6 heads and 4 tails.  Is the coin biased (unfair)?
  - Two hypotheses: 
    - $H_1$: the coin is biased (the true proportion of heads/tails is 0.6
    - $H_2$: the coin is fair (true proportion of heads/tails is 0.5
    - Question: given the data, how much more likely is $H_1$ than $H_2$

3. *Path of belief*: do I really /believe/ this coin will come up heads 60% of the time?
  - No...I have /prior/ beliefs. 
  - One "experiment" with 6 heads does not /change/ my prior beliefs
  

These paths form the basis of three dominant statistical paradigms in the psychological literature:
1. Neyman-Pearson (the most common)
2. Likelihood
3. Bayesian

** Neyman-Pearson method

Historically, our method of hypothesis testing (using $p$-values) is an amalgamation of two (quite different) ideas from a couple of early 20th century statisticians:

- Jerzy Neyman: $p$-value tells you what /action/ to perform.  If $p<\alpha$, then we reject null hypothesis
- Ronald Fisher: $p$-value measures evidence...the smaller the $p$-value, the greater the evidence (this is actually incorrect)
- Note: when I teach undergraduate statistics, I teach /only/ the Neyman method.  - define $H_0$
  - set $\alpha$ (usually 0.05) and find the critical test statistic
  - if test statistic exceeds critical, we we reject $H_0$ (action)
- However, most psychological literature (and many courses) implicitly tack on the incorrect Fisher ideas.  
  - Example: I got $p=0.03$ for "Effect 1" and $p=0.003$ for "Effect 2"..which has "more evidence"?
  - Answer: neither, but Fisher thought Effect 2 would have more evidence
  - this understanding is implicit everywhere in psychology, but it is wrong!
This is why we hyphenate the two and refer to the entire paradigm as "Neyman-Fisher"
