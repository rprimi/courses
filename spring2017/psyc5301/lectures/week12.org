* Review discussion from Week 11

Last week, I asked each student to find an interesting result in the literature and compute a default Bayes factor (using JASP).  We discussed each of these examples from their discussion board in class.

* Student presentations of their analyses of Lab 2 data

Also, I asked each student to begin playing with the Lab 2 data (arithmetic task) in JASP.  We discussed these preliminary analyses in class.

* Review of factorial designs
  - /factors/ - another name for independent variable
    - ex: test mode 
  - /levels/ - the values each factor can take
    - ex: test mode has two levels: visual, auditory
  - an N x M factorial design has /two/ factors; the first with N levels and the second with M levels
  - Example: in our previous study, we had a 2 x 2 design.
  - Example: consider a 2 x 4 design:

|    | B1 | B2 | B3 | B4 |
|----+----+----+----+----|
| A1 |    |    |    |    |
| A2 |    |    |    |    |

The number of /conditions/ is calculated by multiplying the numbers of levels, so a 2x4 design has 8 conditions.

** Anatomy of a 2x2 design

|    | A1                  | A2                  |                  |
|----+---------------------+---------------------+------------------|
| B1 | condition mean A1B1 | condition mean A2B1 | marginal mean B1 |
| B2 | condition mean A1B2 | condition mean A2B2 | marginal mean B2 |
|----+---------------------+---------------------+------------------|
|    | marginal mean A1    | marginal mean A2    |                  |

  - if marginal means differ, this is called a /main effect/
  - if pattern in one variable changes across the levels of the other, this is called an /interaction/

** Advantage of factorial design

If you have only one independent variable, there are only two possible outcomes: there is an effect, or there is not

If you have TWO independent variables, things are much more interesting!

Let 
  - A = main effect of factor A
  - B = main effect of factor B
  - AB = interaction of A and B

Then there are EIGHT possible outcomes:
  - No effects at all
  - A only
  - B only
  - AB only
  - A and B, but not AB
  - A and AB, but not B
  - B and AB, but not A
  - A, B, and AB

** Examples of 2x2 designs

For each of the following:
  - compute the marginal means
  - plot the means
  - decide whether the main effects and/or interactions are significant

|    | A1 | A2 |
|----+----+----|
| B1 | 30 | 60 |
| B2 | 30 | 60 | 

|    | A1 | A2 |
|----+----+----|
| B1 | 60 | 60 |
| B2 | 30 | 30 | 

|    | A1 | A2 |
|----+----+----|
| B1 | 60 | 30 |
| B2 | 30 | 60 | 

|    | A1 | A2 |
|----+----+----|
| B1 | 30 | 60 |
| B2 | 30 | 30 |

** Background
Independent variables:
  - Problem size
    - small: product less than or equal to 25
    - large: product greater than 25
    - within-subjects manipulation
  - Format
    - digits
    - words
    - within-subjects manipulation

Dependent variables:
  - number of problems completed (correctly)
    - related to RT (as RT decreases, # problems increases)
  - number of errors

Past research:
  - problem size effect
    - small problems faster than large problems
    - small problems less error prone than large problems
  - format effect
    - digit problems faster than large problems
    - digit problems less error prone than large problems

The /point/ of our experiment is to examine whether problem size and format *interact*

Additive model of arithmetic (Dehaene and Cohen, 1995)

In this model, format effects are isolated only to encoding processes.

Interactive model of arithmetic (Campbell, 1999)

file:figures/campbell1.jpeg

In this model, format affects both encoding AND calculation.

The critical test between these two models is whether there is a format x problem-size interaction!  This is completely testable in our experiment!  Your task is to test this prediction and arbitrate between these two competing models of mental arithmetic.
