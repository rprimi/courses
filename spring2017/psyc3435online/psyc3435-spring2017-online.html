<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
This laboratory course is designed to introduce students to the philosophy of 
scientific inquiry with an emphasis on experimental methodology. This will be 
accomplished via a combination of traditional lectures along with an application 
of principles through laboratory experimentation and demonstration. Essentially, 
we will cover the "nuts and bolts" of putting together and completing a research 
project in psychology. To this end, we will cover all fourteen chapters of the 
textbook. All students enrolled in this course are required to have 
<b>previously taken</b> PSYC 3309 (Writing in Psychology) and PSYC 3330 (Statistics).

<h2 id="sec-6">Course Communication</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-6">
<p>
I am your primary resource for this course. I AM an experimental psychologist, so I do the stuff I teach about daily. Hence, my primary interest is for you to learn this material and do well in the course. If you have a question, always feel free to stop by my office and visit.  If you require electronic communication, email is best, but you may also send me a Blackboard message.  Just keep in mind that I don't get any notifications of Blackboard messages, so I may not see your message until I next log into the course.

<div id="outline-container-sec-7" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-7">University Policy on "F" Grades</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-7">
<p>
Beginning in Fall 2015, Tarleton will begin differentiating between a failed grade in a class because a student never attended (F0 grade), stopped attending at some point in the semester (FX grade), or because the student did not pass the course (F) but attended the entire semester. These grades will be noted on the official transcript. Stopping or never attending class can result in the student having to return aid monies received.  For more information see the Tarleton Financial Aid website.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-8" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-8">Academic Honesty</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-8">
<p>
Tarleton State University expects its students to maintain high standards of
personal and scholarly conduct. Students guilty of academic dishonesty are
subject to disciplinary action. Cheating, plagiarism (submitting another person’s materials or ideas as one’s own), or doing work for another person who will receive academic credit are all disallowed. This includes the use of unauthorized books, notebooks, or other sources in order to secure of give help during an examination, the unauthorized copying of examinations, assignments, reports, or term papers, or the presentation of unacknowledged material as if it were the student’s own work. Disciplinary action may be taken beyond the academic discipline administered by the faculty member who teaches the course in which the cheating took place.
</p>

<p>
In particular, any exam taken online must be completed without the aid of any unauthorized resource (including using any search engine, Google, etc.).  Authorized resources are limited only to the official textbook and any lecture notes from the course.  Any other authorized resources will be provided to you before the exam.  The minimum sanction for violation of this policy is a grade of 0 on the affected exam.
</p>

<p>
Each student’s honesty and integrity are taken for granted. However, if I find
evidence of academic misconduct I will pursue the matter
to the fullest extent permitted by the university. ACADEMIC MISCONDUCT OR
DISHONESTY WILL RESULT IN A GRADE OF F FOR THE COURSE.  Students are
strongly advised to avoid even the <i>appearance</i> of academic misconduct.

<h3 id="sec-9-1">Academic Integrity Statement</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-9-1">
<p>
Tarleton State University's core values are integrity, leadership, tradition, civility, excellence, and service.  Central to these values is integrity, which is maintaining a high standard of personal and scholarly conduct.  Academic integrity represents the choice to uphold ethical responsibility for one’s learning within the academic community, regardless of audience or situation.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-9-2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-9-2">Academic Civility Statement</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-9-2">
<p>
Students are expected to interact with professors and peers in a respectful manner that enhances the learning environment. Professors may require a student who deviates from this expectation to leave the face-to-face (or virtual) classroom learning environment for that particular class session (and potentially subsequent class sessions) for a specific amount of time. In addition, the professor might consider the university disciplinary process (for Academic Affairs/Student Life) for egregious or continued disruptive behavior.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-9-3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-9-3">Academic Excellence Statement</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-9-3">
<p>
Tarleton holds high expectations for students to assume responsibility for their own individual learning. Students are also expected to achieve academic excellence by:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>honoring Tarleton’s core values, upholding high standards of habit and behavior.
</li>
<li>maintaining excellence through class attendance and punctuality, preparing for active participation in all learning experiences. 
</li>
<li>putting forth their best individual effort.
</li>
<li>continually improving as independent learners.
</li>
<li>engaging in extracurricular opportunities that encourage personal and academic growth.
</li>
<li>reflecting critically upon feedback and applying these lessons to meet future challenges.
</li>
