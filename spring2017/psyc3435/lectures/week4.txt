Ethics in research
==================

  There are two basic categories of ethical concerns
  - consider the rights of our participants in our research
  - behave ethically as scientists and practitioners

  First, we'll talk about the historical precedents for modern ethical
  guidelines:


Nuremberg Code (1949)- developed in response to Nazi atrocities during World War II
===================================================================================

  - participation is voluntary
  - participants must be given information about risks
  - research should contribute to knowledge and conducted by qualified
    researchers
  - researchers must avoid unnecessary harm and ensure that benefits
    outweigh risks
  - participants must have right to quit at any time


APA Code of Ethics (1953)
=========================

  - basically same as Nuremberg code, with two additions
    - researchers must reduce harm due to deception
    - researchers must ensure confidentiality
    - note: original APA code left sole oversight to researchers. This
      led to two infamous experiments that stretched the bounds of the
      APA code:
      - Milgram obedience study (1963)
      - Zimbardo prison experiment (1973)


Belmont report (1979) - list of ethical guidelines in response to Tuskegee syphillis study
==========================================================================================

  - Three principles (and resulting modern research behavior)
    1. Respect for persons (consent form)
    2. Beneficience (risk-benefit analysis and confidentiality)
    3. Justice (fair selection)


Monitoring of ethics - role of IRB
==================================

  - IRB -> Institutional Review Board: a committee of individuals who
    oversee all research with human subjects
  - Researcher submits a protocol to IRB to ensure the following
    criteria are met:
    - minimize risk
    - benefits > risk
    - equal opportunity sampling
    - informed consent w/ documentation
    - data monitoring
    - privacy and confidentiality
