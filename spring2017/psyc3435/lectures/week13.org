This week we will finish talking about nonexperimental designs with two new types of designs: /developmental designs/ and /small N designs/

* Developmental designs

Used to study changes in behavior that occur as a function of /changes in age/
  - age = quasi-independent variable

Three major types:
  - cross-sectional
  - longitudinal
  - cohort-sequential

** Cross-sectional design
  - study groups of individuals of different ages at the same time
  - age is treated as a /between-subjects/ variable

Advantages:
  - much faster -- can gather data about different groups (ages) at the same time

Disadvantages:
  - individuals not followed over time (does not reveal /development/ of individuals)
  - cohort effects: individuals of different ages may be inherently different due to factors in the environment

** Longitudinal design
  - study same invididuals/groups over time
  - age is treated as a /within-subjects/ variable

Advantages:
  - can see developmental changes
  - avoid cohort effects

Disadvantages:
  - time consuming
  - attrition and practice effects

** Cohort-sequential design
  - measure groups of participants as they age
  - combines best parts of cross-sectional and longitudinal designs

* Small $N$ designs

Used to study behavior is a small number of participants.

  - observations begin at /baseline/ (absence of a treatment)
  - Basic idea: you want to show that
    - when treatment occurs, you get an effect
    - when you remove the treatment, the effect reverses

Most common example: ABA design
