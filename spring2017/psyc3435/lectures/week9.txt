This week, we'll talk about factorial designs


Motivation
==========

  So far, all of our experiments have had exactly *one* independent
  variable.  What happens when you have two or more?


Example
~~~~~~~

  Suppose you are interested in the effects of modality (visual versus
  auditory) on memory.  Consider the following experiment:
  - procedure: give participants a list of words to remember
  - IV1: presentation mode (visual, auditory)
  - IV2: test mode (visual, auditory)
  - DV: score on a recognition test ("was this word in the list?")

  One way to approach this is to run two t-tests on memory scores:
  - Test 1: compare means for visual study and auditory study
  - Test 2: compare means for visual test and auditory test

  Here's some data (use JASP dataset?):
  - Study mode:
    - visual study: M = 65
    - auditory study: M = 65

  - Test mode:
    - visual test: M = 65
    - auditory test: M = 65

  - what would we say about the results of our manipulations??
    - no effect of study mode AND no effect of test mode!

  However, we might be missing something:
  - what happens when we consider various combinations of our IVs?

  Data:

                  visual pres  auditory pres 
  -------------------------------------------
   visual test             80             50 
   auditory test           50             80 

  - what happens when we plot these?
  - what story does this data tell?
  - this is a textbook example of an /interaction/, and is the result of
    a *factorial design*


Definitions - Factorial Designs
===============================

  - /factors/ - another name for independent variable
    - ex: test mode
  - /levels/ - the values each factor can take
    - ex: test mode has two levels: visual, auditory
  - an N x M factorial design has /two/ factors; the first with N levels
    and the second with M levels
  - Example: in our previous study, we had a 2 x 2 design.
  - Example: consider a 2 x 4 design:

       B1  B2  B3  B4 
  --------------------
   A1                 
   A2                 

  The number of /conditions/ is calculated by multiplying the numbers of
  levels, so a 2x4 design has 8 conditions.


Anatomy of a 2x2 design
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

       A1                   A2                                    
  ----------------------------------------------------------------
   B1  condition mean A1B1  condition mean A2B1  marginal mean B1 
   B2  condition mean A1B2  condition mean A2B2  marginal mean B2 
  ----------------------------------------------------------------
       marginal mean A1     marginal mean A2                      

  - if marginal means differ, this is called a /main effect/
  - if pattern in one variable changes across the levels of the other,
    this is called an /interaction/


Advantage of factorial design
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  If you have only one independent variable, there are only two possible
  outcomes: there is an effect, or there is not

  If you have TWO independent variables, things are much more
  interesting!

  Let
  - A = main effect of factor A
  - B = main effect of factor B
  - AB = interaction of A and B

  Then there are EIGHT possible outcomes:
  - No effects at all
  - A only
  - B only
  - AB only
  - A and B, but not AB
  - A and AB, but not B
  - B and AB, but not A
  - A, B, and AB


Examples of 2x2 designs
=======================

  For each of the following:
  - compute the marginal means
  - plot the means
  - decide whether the main effects and/or interactions are significant

       A1  A2 
  ------------
   B1  30  60 
   B2  30  60 

       A1  A2 
  ------------
   B1  60  60 
   B2  30  30 

       A1  A2 
  ------------
   B1  60  30 
   B2  30  60 

       A1  A2 
  ------------
   B1  30  60 
   B2  30  30
