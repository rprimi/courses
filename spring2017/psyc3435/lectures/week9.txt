This week, we'll talk about factorial designs


Motivation
==========

  So far, all of our experiments have had exactly *one* independent
  variable.  What happens when you have two or more?


Example
~~~~~~~

  Suppose you are interested in the effects of modality (visual versus
  auditory) on memory.  Consider the following experiment:
  - procedure: give participants a list of words to remember
  - IV1: presentation mode (visual, auditory)
  - IV2: test mode (visual, auditory)
  - DV: score on a recognition test ("was this word in the list?")

  One way to approach this is to run two t-tests on memory scores:
  - Test 1: compare means for visual study and auditory study
  - Test 2: compare means for visual test and auditory test

  Here's some data (use JASP dataset?):
  - Study mode:
    - visual study: M = 65
    - auditory study: M = 65

  - Test mode:
    - visual test: M = 65
    - auditory test: M = 65

  - what would we say about the results of our manipulations??
    - no effect of study mode AND no effect of test mode!

  However, we might be missing something:
  - what happens when we consider various combinations of our IVs?

  Data:

                  visual pres  auditory pres 
  -------------------------------------------
   visual test             80             50 
   auditory test           50             80 

  - what happens when we plot these?
  - what story does this data tell?
  - this is a textbook example of an /interaction/, and is the result of
    a *factorial design*


Definitions - Factorial Desins
==============================

  - /factors/ - another name for independent variable
    - ex: test mode
  - /levels/ - the values each factor can take
    - ex: test mode has two levels: visual, auditory
  - an N x M factorial design has /two/ factors; the first with N levels
    and the second with M levels
  - Example: in our previous study, we had a 2 x 2 design.
  - Example: consider a 2 x 4 design:

       B1  B2  B3  B4 
  --------------------
   A1                 
   A2                 

  The number of /conditions/ is calculated by multiplying the numbers of
  levels, so a 2x4 design has 8 conditions.
