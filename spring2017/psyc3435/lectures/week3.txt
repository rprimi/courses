Building a good research question
=================================

  - Suppose we want to claim that people perform best with a good night
    of sleep
    1. must FOCUS the idea
       - break more general idea into smaller, more specific ideas
         - what do we mean by "performance" -- academic? physical?
         - what do we mean by "good night of sleep" -- 8 hours?
           uninterrupted? 3 hours of REM?
       - develop underlying theoretical model
         - since consolidation of memories happens during REM sleep, we
           can predict that getting more REM sleep should lead to better
           recall
    2. must EVALUATE the idea
       - ROT test -- is it:
         - replicable?
         - observable?
         - testable?
    3. TEST the idea
       - what are the variables of interest?
       - what is the hypothesized relationship between these variables?
       - how should we test it?


Some definitions
================

  - Operational definition - a definition of an abstract concept that is
    formulated in terms of how the concept is being measured
    - Example: define "memory ability" as score on a memory test
  - External validity - the degree to which results of a study apply
    (generalize) to individuals/behaviors outside context of the study
  - Internal validity - the degree to which a study provides *causal*
    information about behavior
  - Reliability - the degree to which the results of a study can be
    replicated under similar conditions


General research methods
========================

  1. Naturalistic observation: observation and description within a
     natural setting
     - high external validity
     - hard to do well
       - reactivity effects
       - takes a long time
       - need multiple observers
  2. Survey methods -- questionnaires/interviews that ask people to
     provide information about themselves
     - widely used
     - best way to collect particular kinds of data (descriptive data,
       preferences, etc.)
     - large amounts of data very quickly
     - difficult to do correctly with high validity
  3. Archival data - examine existing public/private records

  - Note: these are all called "observation without manipulation"
    - Advantages:
      1. can observe complex patterns of behavior
      2. useful when little is known about subject of study
      3. may learn something new that would never have been predicted
    - Disadvantages:
      1. cannot establish causality
      2. threats to internal validity
         - lots of "confounds"
         - lots of alternative explanations
      3. sometimes results are not reproducible

  5. Correlational methods -- measure two (or more) variables for each
     individual and see if the variables co-vary (suggesting they are
     related)
     - used for
       - making predictions
       - establishing reliability and validity
     - problem: cannot make causal claims!

  6. Experiments -- manipulating and controlling variables in laboratory
     experiments
     - involves some type of comparison
       - at least two groups that get compared (random assignment to
         groups)
       - quasi-experiment - groups NOT randomly assigned
     - types of variables
       - Independent variable (IV) -- variable that is manipulated
       - Dependent variable (DV) -- variable that is measured
       - Control variable -- held constant for all participants in
         experiment (either through explicit control or randomization)
