\begin{enumerate}

\item Assume a sample of $n=10$ observations was randomly sampled from a normal distribution with $\sigma=5$.  Suppose that $\overline{x}=78$.

  \begin{enumerate}
  \item test $H_0:\mu>80$, assuming $\alpha=0.05$
  \item produce a plot of the standard normal distribution that shows both the rejection region and the sample $z$-score.
  \item compute a 95\% confidence interval.  Is this interval consistent with your decision in part (a)? Explain.
    \item determine the $p$-value.
  \end{enumerate}

\item Assume a sample of $n=49$ observations was randomly sampled from a normal distribution with $\sigma=5$.  Suppose that $\overline{x}=120$.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item test $H_0:\mu=130$, assuming $\alpha=0.01$.
  \item produce a plot of the standard normal distribution that shows both the rejection region and the sample $z$-score.
  \item compute a 99\% confidence interval.  Is this interval consistent with your decision in part (a)? Explain.
    \item determine the $p$-value.
  \end{enumerate}

\item An antipollution device for cars is claimed to have an average effectiveness of exactly 546. Based on a test of 20 such devices, you find that $\overline{x}=565$.  Assuming normality and that $\sigma=40$, would you rule out the claim with a Type I error probability of 0.05?

\item For $n=36$, $\alpha=0.01$, $\sigma=8$, and $H_0:\mu\leq 100$, compute the power obtained when $\overline{x}=103$.

\item For $n=49$, $\alpha=0.05$, $\sigma=10$, and $H_0:\mu=50$, compute the power obtained when $\overline{x}=47$.
\end{enumerate}
