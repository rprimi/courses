Our goal this week is to talk about describing relationships between two variables.  Particularly, we will introduce the idea of /correlation/, and we'll talk about how to compute a /correlation coefficient/.

* Visualizing "bivariate" data

The most common way to visualize a relationship between two variables is by using a scatter plot.

Two things we can infer from this scatter plot:

1. Direction 
  - positive
    - $x$ and $y$ vary in /the same direction/
    - "As $x$ goes up, $y$ also goes up"
  - negative
    - $x$ and $y$ vary in /opposite directions/
    - "As $x$ goes up, $y$ goes down"

2. Strength -- how are the data spread around the line of best fit?
  - indexed by *correlation coefficient* ($r$), which ranges from -1 to +1
  - $r=0$ --> no relationship
  - values closer to $\pm 1$ indicate stronger relationships

* How do we compute correlation coefficient?

The formula for computing a correlation coefficient is 

\[
r = \frac{\sum Z_xZ_y}{N}
\]

It is literally the "average cross product" of the z-scores

** Example

The computations are trivial..but there is a lot to keep track of.
Let's compute the correlation coefficient $r$ for the data we just plotte above.

Step 1 - compute the standard deviation for $x$ 

|       $x$ | $y$ | $x-M$ |    $(x-M)^2$ |
|-----------+-----+-------+--------------|
|         6 |   6 |   2.4 |         5.76 |
|         1 |   2 |  -2.6 |         6.76 |
|         5 |   6 |   1.4 |         1.96 |
|         3 |   4 |  -0.6 |         0.36 |
|         3 |   2 |  -0.6 |         0.36 |
| $M_x=3.6$ |     |       | $SS_x=15.20$ |

So, 

\[
SD_x 0= \sqrt{\frac{SS_x}{N}} = \sqrt{\frac{15.2}{5}} = 1.74
\]

Step 2 - compute the standard deviation for $y$

|       $x$ |       $y$ | $x-M$ |    $(x-M)^2$ | $y-M$ | $(y-M)^2$ |
|-----------+-----------+-------+--------------+-------+-----------|
|         6 |         6 |   2.4 |         5.76 |     2 |         4 |
|         1 |         2 |  -2.6 |         6.76 |    -2 |         4 |
|         5 |         6 |   1.4 |         1.96 |     2 |         4 |
|         3 |         4 |  -0.6 |         0.36 |     0 |         0 |
|         3 |         2 |  -0.6 |         0.36 |    -2 |         4 |
| $M_x=3.6$ | $M_y=4.0$ |       | $SS_x=15.20$ |       | $SS_y=16$ |

So we have

\[
SD_y = \sqrt{\frac{SS_y}{N}} = \sqrt{\frac{16}{5}} = 1.79
\]

Step 3 -- compute $z$-scores for $x$ and $y$

|         $x$ |         $y$ | $x-M$ |    $(x-M)^2$ | $y-M$ | $(y-M)^2$ | $z_x$ | $z_y$ |
|-------------+-------------+-------+--------------+-------+-----------+-------+-------|
|           6 |           6 |   2.4 |         5.76 |     2 |         4 |  1.38 |   1.1 |
|           1 |           2 |  -2.6 |         6.76 |    -2 |         4 | -1.49 |  -1.1 |
|           5 |           6 |   1.4 |         1.96 |     2 |         4 |   0.8 |   1.1 |
|           3 |           4 |  -0.6 |         0.36 |     0 |         0 | -0.34 |   0.0 |
|           3 |           2 |  -0.6 |         0.36 |    -2 |         4 | -0.34 |  -1.1 |
|   $M_x=3.6$ |   $M_y=4.0$ |       | $SS_x=15.20$ |       | $SS_y=16$ |       |       |
| $SD_x=1.74$ | $SD_y=1.79$ |       |              |       |           |       |       |


Step 4 -- multiply the $z$ scores

|         $x$ |         $y$ | $x-M$ |    $(x-M)^2$ | $y-M$ | $(y-M)^2$ | $z_x$ | $z_y$ | $z_xz_y$ |
|-------------+-------------+-------+--------------+-------+-----------+-------+-------+----------|
|           6 |           6 |   2.4 |         5.76 |     2 |         4 |  1.38 |   1.1 |     1.52 |
|           1 |           2 |  -2.6 |         6.76 |    -2 |         4 | -1.49 |  -1.1 |     1.64 |
|           5 |           6 |   1.4 |         1.96 |     2 |         4 |   0.8 |   1.1 |     0.88 |
|           3 |           4 |  -0.6 |         0.36 |     0 |         0 | -0.34 |   0.0 |        0 |
|           3 |           2 |  -0.6 |         0.36 |    -2 |         4 | -0.34 |  -1.1 |     0.37 |
|   $M_x=3.6$ |   $M_y=4.0$ |       | $SS_x=15.20$ |       | $SS_y=16$ |       |       | sum=4.41 |
| $SD_x=1.74$ | $SD_y=1.79$ |       |              |       |           |       |       |          |

Step 5 -- find the average of the products in step 4

\[
r=\frac{\sum z_xz_y}{N} = \frac{1.52+1.64+0.88+0+0.37}{5} = \frac{4.41}{5} = 0.89
\]

* More examples

* Effect size

One common way in which the correlation coefficient is used in psychological research is to index the /effect size/.  That is, it provides a way to judge the strength of a relationship numerically.

Convention:
  - small: r~0.10
  - medium: r~0.30
  - large: r~0.50
